## Getting started

### Prerequisites
To use Private Box you need:
* Ruby >= 2.4.0
* Node.js >= 10.16.3

### Installation
First, clone or download the repo, then, if you are on *nix/UNIX-Like (Linux, BSD) systems that supports `make`, do:
```sh
make deps
```
on the command line.
If you are on Windows or similar, you can skip this above.

## Usage
To start the WebSocket server and the client, if you are on *nix/UNIX-Like systems, run:
```sh
make
```
Else, if you are on Windows, run
```batch
_start_server.bat
```
to start the WebSocket server, and
```batch
_start_client.bat
```
to start the client.
Then go to https://localhost:4000 and see the magick!
